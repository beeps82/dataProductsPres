## Motor Trend Data
### Relation with MPG 

This report by Motor Trend magazine investigates the relationship between a vehicle parameters and fuel consumption per gallon(MPG). The dataset used here is from the 1974 MotorTrend US magazine. It compromises of 11 aspects of automobile design and performance for 32 automobiles(1973-74 models). We will investigate the factors like transmission, cylinders, displacement, horse power, weight, qsec, gear and number of carburetors that contribute to performance. Also investigate the effects of car manufacturers.

## Contents

### 1. Visualization App

A shiny App visualizes the individual effects of parameters like transmission type, number of gears, vehicle weight, displacement, number of cylinders, etc.. have on vechicle performance in MPG. The data is grouped and effects of manufacturers are also visible(the data is limited to 32 observations)

## Motor Cars Trend Data

```{r,echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
options(warn=-1)
library(Hmisc);
data(mtcars)
```
### Exploratory Data Analyses
There seem to be no missing values or nothing out of the ordinary in this dataset 

```{r,echo = FALSE}
#describe(data.frame(MPG = mtcars$mpg, AM = mtcars$am))
head(mtcars,head=1,tail=1)
```

```{r,echo =FALSE,fig.width=7, fig.height=2}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = factor(am), y = mpg)) + 
       geom_boxplot(aes(fill = factor(am))) + coord_flip()+ 
        ylab("MPG") + xlab("Auto (0), Manual (1)")
```

```

## Usage

* Choose a vehicle parameter(transmission,gear,hp,..) to compare with MPG
* Select a vehicle make(select all by default)
